# News Scraper

This project is a simple Python-based web scraper that extracts the latest headlines and corresponding links from a news website and saves them into a JSON or CSV file. The project is structured into modular components for ease of use, maintainability, and scalability.

## Project Structure

```bash
news_scraper/
│
├── fetcher.py         # Handles the web request to fetch page content
├── parser.py          # Scrapes and parses the HTML content for headlines and URLs
├── saver.py           # Saves the extracted data into JSON or CSV files
├── main.py            # Main script that integrates the functionality
├── __init__.py        # Empty file to mark the directory as a package
└── README.md          # Project documentation
```

### Components:
1. **`fetcher.py`**: Contains the function to fetch the webpage content using HTTP requests.
2. **`parser.py`**: Includes the function to parse the HTML content and extract headlines and URLs.
3. **`saver.py`**: Provides the functionality to save extracted data in either JSON or CSV format.
4. **`main.py`**: The main script that integrates all the modules and executes the scraping and saving process.
5. **`__init__.py`**: Required to treat the directory as a Python package.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- The following Python libraries are required:
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  
Install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

### Cloning the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/news-scraper.git
cd news_scraper
```

## Usage

1. **Edit `main.py`** to specify the target URL of the news website you want to scrape. The `base_url` and `url` parameters should match the structure of the news website.

```python
# main.py
base_url = 'https://example-news-website.com'
url = f'{base_url}/latest-news'  # Update this based on the website's structure
```

2. **Run the script**:

```bash
python main.py
```

3. The script will scrape the latest headlines and links from the news website and save the result into either a `headlines.json` or `headlines.csv` file based on the `output_format` specified in the `main.py` file.

By default, it is set to output as `JSON`:

```python
output_format = 'json'  # Change to 'csv' if you want CSV output
```

### Example JSON Output:
```json
[
    {
        "headline": "Breaking News: Example Event",
        "url": "https://example-news-website.com/news/breaking-news-example-event"
    },
    {
        "headline": "Latest Updates on Example",
        "url": "https://example-news-website.com/news/latest-updates-example"
    }
]
```

### Example CSV Output:
```
headline,url
"Breaking News: Example Event","https://example-news-website.com/news/breaking-news-example-event"
"Latest Updates on Example","https://example-news-website.com/news/latest-updates-example"
```

## Customization

### Changing the Website
To scrape a different website, change the `base_url` and `url` in `main.py`. Additionally, update the HTML tags used for headlines in `parser.py` to match the website's structure. For example, if the headlines are inside `<h1>` or `<article>`, adjust the `scrape_headlines()` function accordingly.

### Changing the Output Format
By default, the script saves the headlines in JSON format. You can switch to CSV output by changing the `output_format` variable in `main.py`:

```python
output_format = 'csv'  # Change to 'json' if you want JSON output
```

## Handling Errors
- **Malformed HTML**: If the HTML structure is missing expected elements (like headlines or links), the script skips over those elements and continues.
- **HTTP Errors**: If the page cannot be fetched (e.g., 404 or 500 errors), the script handles the error and displays an appropriate message.
